# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python. 

# In[2]:


##This is a simple arithmetic example to multiply then add integers. 
x=3
y=4
z=5
num = (x*y)+z
print(num)


# In[4]:


##This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 
min=200
hours=min/60
print(hours)


# Objectives:
